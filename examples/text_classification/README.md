# Text Classification

This folder contains examples of text classification models.

## What is Text Classification?

>Text classification is a supervised learning method of learning and predicting the category or the class of a document given its text content.
>The state-of-the-art methods are based on neural networks of different architectures as well as pre-trained language models or word embeddings.

Accuracy scores (ACC) are calculated by running code only in fold 0 in the condition that datasets are devided into train/val/test at the rate of 0.6/0.2/0.2.
Be careful that the scores are highly affected by the way of splitting dataset and hyperparameters like the number of epochs.
